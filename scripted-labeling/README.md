# scripted-labeling

Follows the approach of adding labels like job programming languages via a simple word search.

Dropped this approach as it became clear that I would have to work with Regexes and pivoted to gpt.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.21. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
